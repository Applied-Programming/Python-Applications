# Check Current Weather using Python

This program prints the current weather for a location you specify. We will use the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap.org</a>'s API to fetch the weather data. 

First sign in at http://home.openweathermap.org/ and proceed to create your own API key. Once you have the API, enter it in the code-line _appID = 'YOUR-OWN-OPENWEATHERMAP-API_ in place of YOUR-OWN-OPENWEATHERMAP-API.

The output would look like:
